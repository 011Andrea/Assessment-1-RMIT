  <h1>My Interest In Information Technology</h1>
<br>
<p>My interest in IT began many years ago in 1985 when the very first Windows operating system was introduced.
I began a secretarial course that offered me the option of learning either Word Perfect or Word for Windows.
Not understanding the difference at the time, I chose Word Perfect. I did not know the difference at the time
except that Word Pefect was mainly being used, so I chose this option. It did turn out to be a good choice because
I had to use MS Dos, so it introduced me to what went on behind the scenes of a GUI. This is where my passion to 
learn about using computers began. As information technology rapidly took hold of the world, it was amazing to watch 
the capabilities that computers had. However, at this stage I did not realise the full extent. In the mid 1990's I was
employed in a position where my duties where to research worldwide telephone rates for the organisations programmers
to use in a phone monitoring application. In 1998 while engaged in this company the internet was introduced to 
Australia and I was lucky enough to have access through the organisation. Now I really was fascinated. Over time 
I spend copious amounts of time learning everything I could to get the most out of my computer, phone and any other device 
I owned. I loved the feeling of making these intelligent machines do incredible things and I found it rewarding 
to be able to resolve any issues that might arise, detecting and removing viruses. I had become very confident in
using, fixing and networking all of my devices when I began a forensics course at Curtin University. I have a really
driven desire to make a difference in the world. I thought that if I could solve crimes that I could bring Justice
to the community and peace to victims of crime and their families. One of my lecturers noticed how driven I was and
came to me. She asked if I had investigated future career prospects. When i looked into available positions I discovered 
that there was not a lot available in Western Australia. For personal reasons I could not continue my studies at 
that time so I decided to take another direction. After gaining other qualifications, I still could not find anything I
Was passionate about. So I investigated my options and found the oportunity to study through RMIT. I realised that I could
combine my passion for forensics and investigation and information technology. This is where my journey in my undergraduate
  in Computer Sciences began.</p>

networking. These are exactly the skills I want to aquire. The skills i already have are a very good understanding of criminal behaviour, It is
something I spend a lot of time researching. I also have excellent communication skills and am very good at reading people. I already have a sound
knowledge of Windows and Android and am very passionate about preventing crime. I enjoy coding and able to work unsupervised and am very driven.
I have contacted Open Universities about obtaining the best knowledge for this type of position and have asked to take a double major to broaden
