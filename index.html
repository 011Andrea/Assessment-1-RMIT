<h1>My Interest In Information Technology</h1>
<br>
<p>My interest in IT began many years ago in 1985 when the very first Windows operating system was introduced.
I began a secretarial course that offered me the option of learning either Word Perfect or Word for Windows.
Not understanding the difference at the time, I chose Word Perfect. I did not know the difference at the time
except that Word Pefect was mainly in use, so I chose this option. It did turn out to be a good choice because
I had to use MS Dos. This introduced me to what went on behind the scenes of a GUI. This is where my passion to 
learn about using computers began. As information technology rapidly took hold of the world, it was amazing to watch 
the capabilities that computers had. However, at this stage I did not realise the full extent. In the mid 1990's I was
employed in a position where my duties where to research worldwide telephone rates for the organisations programmers
to use in a phone monitoring application. In 1998 while engaged in this company the internet was introduced to 
Australia and I was lucky enough to have access through the organisation. Now I really was fascinated. Over time 
I spend copious amounts of time learning everything I could to get the most out of my computer, phone and any other device 
I owned. I enjoyed making these intelligent machines do incredible things and I found it rewarding 
to be able to resolve any issues that might arise, detecting and removing viruses. I had become very confident in
using, fixing and networking my devices. I began a forensics course at Curtin University. I have a really
driven desire to make a difference in the world. I thought that if I could solve crimes that I could bring justice
to the community and peace to victims of crime and their families. One of my lecturers noticed how driven I was and
came to me. She asked if I had investigated future career prospects. When I looked into available positions I discovered 
that there was not a lot available in Western Australia. For personal reasons I could not continue my studies at 
that time so I decided to take another direction. After gaining other qualifications and working in various positions, 
I still could not find anything I was passionate about. So I investigated my options and found the oportunity to study through RMIT. 
I realised that I could combine my passion for forensics, investigation and information technology. This is where my journey in my undergraduate
in Computer Sciences began.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<br>
<p>I am pursuing a career in Cyber Forensics below is an example of my ideal future position.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>This position is exactly the sort of position I am looking to achieve. It appeals to me because it is a true forensics type of role collecting 
evidence and resolving security issues. I like the idea of the customer liason because I enjoy and am confident dealing with people.
It has  world class training and support, is with a company that has been voted a great place to work. The position offers amazing opportunities
and is with an executive company that has good employee recognition and invests heavily in its employees. The salary and incentives would fulfill my dreams.
The skills required for this job would require me to learn many different types of security software. I would need to learn
networking and the various security applications required for the position. These are exactly the skills I want to aquire. The skills I already have 
are, a very good understanding of criminal behaviour, it is something I spend a lot of time researching. I also have excellent communication skills and
am very good at reading people. I already have a sound knowledge of Windows and Android and am very passionate about preventing crime. I enjoy coding, 
able to work unsupervised and am very driven. I have contacted Open Universities about obtaining the best knowledge for this type of position and have asked to take a double major to broaden 
how best to enhance the scope of my abilities.</p>
<br>
<br>
  <h1>Personality Test</h>
<br>
  <br>
 <p>I feel that the results of the Myer Briggs Personality test is accurate even though the questions are open to interpretation.
When selecting a team, I will need to choose people that are also ambitious and driven. I would want to have people that are able respect one another and
focus on the task at hand.</p>

<br>

<br>
<h1>What does this test mean for me?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>This test is also interesting, I am happy with the results. I do not know how accurate these tests are. I do have many of these traits but the 
questions are very open ended. I think that in a team, it depends on many things, I believe the other team members attitudes have a big impact on the success
of a project. When choosing a team, I feel that balance of personalities is important.</p>
<br>
<img src="lStyleSnip1.jpg" alt="Image" height="300" width="250" />
</a>
<br>
<p>Once again I feel these questions include so many factors. Whether the questions are relevant to a persons prior knowledge of a subject. If a person
has recently had to answer similar questions. I have not attended high school for many years. I know that my results would be very different if
I had taken them when I was younger. Does it make me unintelligent if the questions are foriegn to me.</p>
<br>
<h1>This is an IQ test.</h1>

<font = face "arial" size = "3">
<br>
<p>As a sideline to a Cyber Security position, I would like to create a program to educate young people how to be safe it various situations and assess
if children are being exposed to abuse. The purpose of the game would be to expose children various scenarios and get them thinking about their choices
in real life. It would ask questions in a careful manner. The idea would be to expose and educate a child about many negative things that a young person
can be exposed to that they may have never thought about. The game would offer real life solutions and could be used as a diagnosis tool for schools and
child protection agencies. The focus would be on prompting the user to think about situations they may encounter throughout their younger years so that
if the situations arises in real life, they have given some consideration to the consequences of their choices. It would offer them resources to talk 
about and report issues.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>My motivation for this application is to prevent children from becoming the victims of crime, making choices that can bring a 
major negative effect to their lives or get them into legal trouble. I have a passion to bring this kind of education into the mainstream.
Although these topics are something that people do not like to think about, they exist in society with 4 out of 10 children being subjected
to abuse and neglect and 90% of these reports are of a serious nature.
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-16/australia-facing-an-epidemic-of-child-abuse-and-neglect/10233898</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>The application could be used to discreetly assess if a child is being subjected to any abuse without intimidating questioning. It would educate the child
of personal health care and safety. The program would give children advice on things to do to better care for themselves and others, giving
suggestions how to deal with different situations. The program would include phone numbers like Kids Helpline and advice to inform a teacher or
safe adult. The game would allow the user to the understand the consequences of their choices educating the player about real life situations along the way.
For example, if they said that they would enter their personal information into a website. They could have the money they have earnt in the game stolen.
This would inform the user of the risks of disclosing personal information online. It could include health care questions and education.
The program could output funny cartoons that show the result, an example would be maybe dental hygiene. It would question if the child brushes
their teeth every day. If the user said no a funny face with no teeth could appear. The child could give him back his teeth by interactive actions
like brushing teeth and filling holes at the dentist. The program would address less serious issues. In amongst these questions and options
the program could discreetly assess serious situations that are of concern making the assessment process less confronting. The game would allow 
parents or teachers to set age levels and the game would output storylines that would be appropriate for the age of the user. The game could be
further developed for teenagers. When the game is set for this age it could assess and educate young people using more complex games and information.
It could offer them scenarios with options to use drugs, commit crimes or practice unsafe sex. It could them make them aware of the consequences with 
humorous advice. It could offer them options could lead them into situations where they have to work out how to escape or save themself. It could include
battles with the bad guys and working out the best way to get out of circumstances their choices have gotten them into. They could collect items along the 
way earning money as points, earning rewards for good choices and losing money and rewards for bad choices. The program would include carefully chosen 
comments to build the users confidence and self-esteem. At the end of the game, the program could output a report that can be interprated by a parent, 
teacher or child welfare agency. The program could then suggest if further action is necessary and suggest the appropriate authority or action to deal
with the outcome.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Tools</h1>
<br>
<p>Initially this game would be developed to be played a graphical user interface for a windows operating system. As the game gains popularity other
operating systems could be considered. At this stage I do not know the best development option for the game. The project would involve conducting 
research on appropriate content through welfare agencies and child psychologists.Research will include the appropriate software to develop a game of
this nature.</p> 
<br>
<h1>Barriers</h1>
<br>
<br> 
<h1>Skills Required</h1>
<br>
<p>The skills required for this product will be the ability to create a gaming program. I do not yet have these skills but once research has been conducted
and the right program is decided I will be able to gain the skills through online resources. I will need to consult with many people on the best way to
execute many of the aspects of this project. These people will include gaming programmers, child experts. educational experts and other criteria as the
issues are realised during the planning and developement stages. There are many aspect of the project that need further consideration. The project would 
need a team to be successful.</p>
<br>
The outcome of the project would be a fully function graphical user interface interactive game for children ranging in ages from 5 to 15 years of age.
The application would be pitched to schools, child protection agencies and parents. The application would be a tool to educate children in many circumstances 
how to avoid risky behaviours and to make good choices in real life situations. The aim would be to improve the quality of life for children throughout the
world. It would impower children to report abusive situations, making it less confronting when care givers are trying to assess if children are involved in
abusive situations and educate children that may not have good standards in everyday self care. It would help to prevent children from becoming victims 
of online and real life exploitation. The objective of the project would be to intervene in an out of control situation that is the current epidemic in 
locally and globally.
